    "If you're new to Python, the tricksiest line in this code was the line with `seq.extend()` on it. Let's dwell on that for a second because we can learn a fair amount of Python all at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "`seq` is a **list**. You can see that because of how we initialize it (`seq = []`). We can look at the documentation for Python lists and see that we can add to them either one item at a time with `append()` or we can add a list of several items at once with `extend()`. Variables in Python (lists, and integers, and floats, and dicts, and whatever) are _objects_ with _methods_: so when we do something like `seq.extend()` we are saying \"invoke the `extend()` method in the `seq` object\", and the stuff in the parentheses is the argument to `extend()`: it will be interpreted as a list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, it's a list of the A|C|G|T characters on one line of the GenBank file. You can see us open the file (`open(seqfile) as f`) so that we have an open **file object** `f`, and then we're reading one line at a time from the file in a loop (`for line in f`) in a way where the variable `line` is a **string** containing something like \"1240 ACGTACGATCAG ACGACTGATCTCA\", because lines in Genbank files start with coordinates and also have spaces. We're waiting in the file until the sequence part is about to start (after a line that says 'ORIGIN'), and we stop when there's a line that says '//', by checking `line` with a string method `.startswith()` that tests for exact matching to a query string at the start of `line`. So that's what the `in_sequence` flag is doing: it gets set to `True` when we're in the sequence part of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, back to the argument to `seq.extend()`, which needs to be a list, but `line` is a string, not a list. We also want to skip the coordinates and the spaces in the line, and only extend `seq` with a list of A|C|G|T characters on `line`. We can iterate over each character in `line` with a for loop: `for x in line`. We could write a few lines of code to initialize a new list, iterate over each character x in `line`, check whether the character is A|C|G|T before we include it, and convert the character to upper case (if it's a lower-case a|c|g|t), but we can do all of this very compactly using something called a **list comprehension**. If we did `[x for x in line]` we would get a list of the characters in `line`. The first `x` there is \"put this thing in the new list...\" and the `for x in line` is \"... for each successive x in line\". We can put anything we want into the new list as we do the `for x in line`, including some sort of operation on `x`: here, we're using the `x.upper()` method to convert `x` to upper case. Finally, Python's list comprehension syntax allows us to append an `if` test for each iteration of the for loop: here, `if x.isalpha()`, where `isalpha()` is a method with no argument that returns True if `x` is an alphabetic character: this is the piece of our code that is skipping spaces and numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whew. Got that?\n",
    "\n",
    "No, it would be easy to still be confused. How should you figure this out as you're learning? The technique I advise to use throughout the course (and indeed throughout life) is, whatever you're trying to understand, create the smallest possible example where you know what the answer is supposed to be, and make sure you can do that first. Then move outwards to more and more complex things, once you've nailed the small things. And in the case of Python: use a lot of print statements when you do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here's an example; let's peel apart that list comprehension in a code block of its own in our Markdown, where we can play.\n",

    "One thing to notice here: `data[:,0]` is what's called a **slice** of an array. matplotlib (and Pandas) are very column-oriented in how they think about 2D data tables. The scatter plot function `ax.scatter()` expects to get a list/array of `n` x coordinates and a corresponding list of `n` y coordinates for the points it will plot; but our data are in an Lx2 array. `data[:,0]` is the syntax for \"give me all of the rows\" (that's the ':') and give me just column 0 (that's the '0'): i.e., extract the X coords as a single array. `data[:,1]` are the y coords. You know the drill: look up array slicing, make a small example in an isolated cell, and play with lots of print statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "matplotlib is big and complicated and I won't say much about it for now; best to start with their tutorial, to understand the syntax. But here's one thing to know up front. There are two main ways of using matplotlib. In one way, you basically assume that you're just making a simple single figure, and you directly call matplotlib functions with `plt.` prefixes, like `plt.plot()`. The other way is \"object oriented\", where you create and manipulate Figure and Axes objects. That's what I'm doing here: creating a Figure and Axes object for my figure with `fig, ax = plt.subplots`, and then using object-oriented methods calls on those objects with things like `ax.scatter()` to create and design my plot. I recommend following this pattern and using the object-oriented style, becuse it's easier to control in something like a jupyter notebook where you have lots of figures at once. I _don't_ recommend mixing the two styles, which is what you will get if you learn matplotlib by googling StackOverflow.\n",
